# HAPT-Recognition
Human Activities and Postural Transitionsâ€™ Recognition using Smartphone Data

## PROBLEM STATEMENT DESCRIPTION
Human activities are monitored with the help of Smartphone sensors(Acclerometer and Gyroscope). The statement is to classify the human activities into one of 12 classes based on these sensor readings.

## DATASET
[Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions "UCI Machine Learning Repository")

### Data Visualization 
Data is visualized using 2-D PCA and TSNE embeddings. TSNE visualization shows that the different classes are well seperable.
